# Exercise 03 - Basics - Array

## Aim

In this exercise, we learn the basics of array.

## Exercise

In this exercise, we learn how to process data in an array format.

`data.json` file contains an array of Pokemons. [JSON](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Objects/JSON#no_really_what_is_json) is a commonly used format to structure data in web development.

Prerequisite: Copy the JSON data into your program as a JSON string and parse it into a an array.

Write a function:

- Has one parameter that is the _name_ of a Pokemon.
- Look through the provided data and find the Pokemon with the matching name ( case insensitive ), and return its details.
- Write test for the function

For example:

- Given "Bulbasaur", return the element at index 0
- Given "caTERPIE", return the element at index 9

## Extra

- Print the Pokemon to terminal with its stats converted to graded scale N -> UR.

For example:

```
ID: 000
Name: Pokemon Name
Types: Type1, Type2
Stats:
  HP: N
  Attack: R
  Defense: R
  Special Attack: SR
  Special Defense: SR
  Speed: UR
```

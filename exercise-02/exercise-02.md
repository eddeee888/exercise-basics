# Exercise 02 - Function basics - For loop

## Aim

In this exercise, we learn how to loop through a string with for loop.

## Exercise

Write a function:

- Take a mathematical string that consists of "+", "-" and numbers with any digits.
- Must calculate, return the result and handle invalid cases.

For example:

- Given "1+9-5", return "5"
- Given "100-200+5", return "-95"
- Given "100+-2", throw error
- Given "10a+20", throw error
- Given "10 + 20", throw error
